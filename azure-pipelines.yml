# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

# trigger:
#   branches:
#     include: 
#     - main
#     - release/*
#     exclude:
#     - release/old*

# pool:
#   vmImage: ubuntu-latest

# steps:
# - bash: echo "Trigger Release pipeline!"
#   displayName: 'Run a one-line script'
